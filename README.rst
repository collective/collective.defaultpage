Introduction
============

A folder view, which selects the first page in a folder which the user can access.
This can be useful if you want different default pages for different users or
groups in a folder.

Usage
-----

Just activate the extension in Plone add-ons and select the default-page-view
in folders display menu. You can then put multiple pages in the folder and
the first page which can be view, would be present to the user.

Please note: For users with the manager or review role, the folder_summary_view
will be show instead of redirecting.
